# New York Citi Bike Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a hybrid course and portfolio data analysis project using New York Citi Bike trip data. 
The goal is to explore customer behavior and usage patterns across different age groups, user types, and days of the week, 
and translate insights into practical recommendations.

## Key Questions
- What are the most popular Citi Bike pick-up locations?
- How does average trip duration vary across different age groups?
- Which age group rents the most bikes?
- How does usage differ between one-time users and long-term subscribers across weekdays and weekends?
- Does user age impact average trip duration?

## Dataset

## Tools & Methods
